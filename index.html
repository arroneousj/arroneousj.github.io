            <p>
                Returned to snowboarding recently using a secondhand board that my father bought when he started.
                I couldn't find much detail on the board itself other than the company briefly existed in the mid 90s as an extention of a skateboard company.
                However, with a length of 160cm, it was too stiff for the type of riding that I wanted to do.
                So for my new board, I looked to get one that was a fair bit shorter, and more flexible.
                Doing a ton of research and going down the rabbit hole of snowboards.
                I decided a Cam-Rock profiled board aligned with what I was looking for. But more on that later.
                I picked up a new snowboard as well as bindings towards the end of the 20/21 season with the end of season sales.
                I luckily managed to get a couple more runs in before the season ended so I got to try the board out.
                Below is a table of the specs for the board for those more keen on those details.

                Compared with my old board, the difference in length was definitely noticeable. I had definitely become accustomed to riding a longer board.
                The new board retained less speed, was less stable at speed, and less stable in rutted out terrain.
                All these attributes were expected. But I certainly missed and whished my new board was more stable.
                But on the flip side, I loved the maneuverablity and flexibility of the board. In fact, I wished it was even more flexible.
                But I can't have both as having more of one will generally decrease the other. Maybe I could go another 2cm shorter.
                Or maybe go with a board with a lower flex rating. But I'll lose even more of my stablility, speed, and stability at speed.
                So in an odd way, I might have luckily landed within that happy medium.
            </p>
            <p>
                The bindings that I chose to pick up with the snowboard were the
                <a href="https://unionbindingcompany.com/products/force" rel="https://unionbindingcompany.com" style="color: whitesmoke;" title="Product Page">20/21 Union Force Bindings</a>.
                Combined, I really liked how locked in and reponsive the snowboard felt underfoot. However, with the stiffer bindings. I felt limited in my ability to learn how to press, 
                "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Pu0ANT7Fc4&ab_channel=HINAKOS" rel="https://youtube.com" style="color: whitesmoke;" title="Example video 17-18season hina snowboard">butter</a>",
                and other various flatground tricks.
                As a work around, I have played around with not cranking my ankle straps all the way down to effectively increase the amount of flex in the bindings.
                Allowing me to more easily project my weight out over my nose and tail.
                Now I do not necessarily recommend you do the same as I can't guarantee there being risks that I haven't realized.
                But it can be something you could look to consider trying if this is an issue you're running into.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nothing crazy boot wise. I'm riding in a pair of 20/21 K2 Maysis boots.
                I got them at a sample/pre-season sale so they aren't the official final release ones.
                But they're solid. They have a stiffness rating of 7/10 which seems to be on the stiffer end.
                But, to be honest, I'm not sure if I've really noticed. I definitely haven't ran into any issues with them.

                So what do all these specifications mean and why might they be important you ask?
                <br> - Correct Sizing (Length, Waist, Stance Width, Rider Weight, Flex)
                <br>It could probably be inferred from above that the a longer board rides faster and rides more stable at speed.
                <br> - Shape (True Twin, Directional Twin, Directional, Asymmetrical, Volume Shifted)
                <br> - Profile (Camber, Reverse Camber (Rocker), Flat, Hybrid)
                <br> - Extra nerdy: Sintered/Extruded Base, Edge Tech, Efective Edge, Sidecut Radius
