# arroneousj.github.io

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @arroneousj
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML

Goals:
- Have fun
- Create a webpage to develop some very basic understanding of HTML
- Utilize git to familiarize myself with some of the commands and functionalities

The contents of the page is a casual conversation about various interests and activites that I am mildly obsessed about.
Can utilize as a pseudo "appendix" to the interest section of my resume

Note to self:
 - Snowboarding
 - Current Denim
 - Watch Wishlist
 - Guitars
